 * Hi. Thank you for downloading Scriptable.
 * This script highlights some of the
 * features in the app. It fetches the latest
 * news from MacStories and presents the
 * headlines along with an image in a table. 
 * You can even run the script from a
 * Siri Shortcut.
 * 
 * To run the script press the "Play" icon in
 * the top center of the screen.
 * 
 * Congratulations! You've just run your
 * first script in Scriptable. 
 * 
 * Now let's create a Siri Shortcut. 
 * Press the "Gear" icon in the upper left
 * corner of the screen. This will present
 * the script settings. Press "Add to Siri".
 * Follow the instructions on the screen.
 * 
 * If you've created a Siri Shortcut, 
 * trigger the shortcut with Siri.
 * This presents the latest news inside
 * of Siri without even opening the app.
 * 
 * Alright. It's time to become familiar
 * with some of the APIs that Scriptable
 * provides. Remember that you can always
 * find the documentation for these APIs
 * by pressing the "Book" icon in the 
 * upper right corner.
 * 
 * You will find comments explaining what
 * is going on in each of the steps in the
 * script below.

// 1. First we need to fetch the news.
// We create a Request object which can
// make HTTP requests.
// MacStories provide their news in a JSON
// feed. The Request object can automatically
// parse JSON by calling the "loadJSON()"
// function. Note that "await" keyword here.
// "loadJSON()" returns a native JavaScript
// promise. This is an object which will
// provide a value sometime in the future.
// We use "await" to wait for this value
// and halt execution of the script in the 
// mean time.
let url = "https://macstories.net/feed/json"
let req = new Request(url)
let json = await req.loadJSON()
// 2. We want to present the articles in a
// table, so we create a new UITable.
// A table contains rows which are displayed
// vertically. A row in turn contains cells
// which are displayed horizontally.
let table = new UITable()
for (item of json.items) {
  // For each item, i.e. each story, we
  // create a row in the table.
  let row = new UITableRow()
  // Call our extractImageURL function to
  // extract an image URL from the HTML body
  // of the story.
  let body = item["content_html"]
  let imageURL = extractImageURL(body)
  // Call our decode() function to decode
  // HTML entities from the title.
  let title = decode(item.title)
  // Add an image cell to the row. Cells are
  // displayed in the order they are added,
  // from left to right.
  let imageCell = row.addImageAtURL(imageURL)
  // Add the title cell to the row.
  let titleCell = row.addText(title)
  // Set the width weights of our cells.
  // Cell widths are relative. In this case
  // we have two cells, imageCell with a
  // widthWeight of 20 and titleCell with a
  // widthWeight of 80. This gives us a
  // total widthWeight of 20 + 80 = 100.
  // So the imageCell will fill 20/100 (20%)
  // of the available screen space and the
  // titleCell will fill 80/100 (80%) of
  // the available screen space.
  imageCell.widthWeight = 20
  titleCell.widthWeight = 80
  // Set height of the row and spacing
  // between cells, in pixels.
  row.height = 60
  row.cellSpacing = 10
  // Add the row to the table.
  // Rows are displayed in the order
  // they are added.
  table.addRow(row)
}
// Presents the table using the QuickLook
// bridge. "Bridges" is the concept that
// allows JavaScript to use native iOS
// APIs. For example, presenting the table
// with QuickLook will present a native view
// containing the table. The same API also
// works in Siri.
QuickLook.present(table)
// We want Siri to say a kind message when
// the script is run using a Siri Shortcut.
// We use the global variable "config" to
// determine how the script is being run.
// The Speech bridge will speak a text using
// Siri. While this also works when the
// script is run with the app, it's much
// more enjoyable when the script is run
// from a Siri Shortcut.
